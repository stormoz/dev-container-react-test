# My React App

## TODO:
- lock versions of tools e.g. ef cli

## Prerequisites
> NB: this application is configured to run using Dev Container Docker environment. All application specific dependencies (e.g. .NET SDK) is automatically installed inside the Docker container

- Install Docker for Desktop
- Install VS Code
- Open the repository in VS Code
- Add Git username and email to the repository (NB: Dev Container will copy it automatically)
  - `git config user.email "<you@example.com>"`
  - `git config user.name "<Your Name>"`
- Install "Dev Containers" extension by Microsoft
- In command pallet of VS Code run "Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container" (NB: it may take some time to finish, please be patient)
- Authenticate to project via Git

## Start app
- In VS Code run or debug "Start App" launch configuration
or
- In VS Code run `npm start`

> NB: the configuration will restore packages and start app

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
